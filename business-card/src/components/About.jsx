                Hey! I'm a new Adjunkt here at CPH Business.
                I have since my graduation in 2018, worked 2,5 years as a consultant, 
                where i have been far and wide, and gained lots of experience,
                both in frontend and backend, so I have a pretty solid knowledge to the stack.
                Just before i joined CPH Business, I was a year with "Udviklings- og Forenklingsstyrelsen", 
                as a frontend developer.
            </p>
        </div>
