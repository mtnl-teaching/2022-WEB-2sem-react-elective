# travel-journal

Requirements:

1. Design according to their [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/QG4cOExkdbIbhSfWJhs2gs/Travel-Journal?node-id=0%3A1)
2. From create-react-app
3. Data Driven
   1. All data stored in a 'data.js' file
   2. Title, location, google maps link, start and end date, description and image url
      (If you are using their image urls from unsplash, make sure you go to unsplash and get the correct link to the image)
4. **Combine all of your skills so far! I expect to see Components, props and .map()**
5. (Extra: Make the google maps link conditional, so your component can handle if no link is given)

return(</div>
<input onBlur={console.log(input.target.value)}/&gt;</div>

<div>    );</div>
